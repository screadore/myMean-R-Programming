##Functionality Check for myMean function to ensure answers are the same##
#Data source is equal to "assignment". This is a vector of different values that we want to then use the myMean function to find the mean 

assignment <-c(16,18,14,22,27,17,19,17,17,22,20,22)

#Function being used is the "mean" function as myMean. 

myMean = (sum(assignment)/length(assignment))
c(myMean)
[1] 19.25

##Functionality Check Finished##

# The original source code for this module includes 
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment)/length(someData)) }

#Using the myMean and original code to calculate the mean of assignment

assignment2 <-c(16,18,14,22,27,17,19,17,17,22,20,22)
> myMean <- function(assignment2)
+ {return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}
> myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.25

#Answer of 19.25 is correct as it was double checked. The original source code problem was that it returned an object
not found error due to the inability to verify the object the command was calling upon to then carry out the function.
So to fix this issue I had to implement assignment2 into the sum and length functions for it to calculate it right and add the
assignment2 call to the function.##
